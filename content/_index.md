description: A blog for DFIR, Malware Analysis, and anything in-between!

Welcome to my website! I will use this website as a blog to document my research and analysis into various malware samples and how they affect systems. The papers I will include in the blog pages will contain thorough analysis of the samples and a forensic investigation into the effects it has on the affected machines.

I have also included links to my accounts on various platforms such as LinkedIn, Github, and TryHackMe!
