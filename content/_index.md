description: I am a cybersecurity specialist, primarily specialising in malware analysis, digital forensics, and incident response. I will cover these and various CTF/Pentesting challenges (walkthrough and creation) on this website. There are also links to my LinkedIn, Github, and TryHackMe profiles.

Welcome to my website! I will use this website as a blog to document my research and analysis into various malware samples and how they affect systems. The papers I will include in the blog pages will contain thorough analysis of the samples and a forensic investigation into the effects it has on the affected machines.

I have also included links to my accounts on various platforms such as LinkedIn, Github, and TryHackMe!
